# Network Vulnerability Scanner

This is a Python-based network vulnerability scanner that uses Nmap to scan specified targets for open ports, services, operating systems, and vulnerabilities. The tool generates a detailed HTML report containing the results of the scan.

## Features
- Scans network targets for open ports and services.
- Detects operating systems and versions.
- Identifies vulnerabilities using Nmap's `vuln` script.
- Generates an HTML report displaying open ports and detected services.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Nmap** (network scanning tool)
- Python libraries: 
  - `nmap` (Nmap Python bindings)
  - `PrettyTable` (for tabular display in reports)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-vulnerability-scanner.git
    cd network-vulnerability-scanner
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the tool:

    ```bash
    python3 scanner.py
    ```

2. Enter the target IP address or domain when prompted.

3. After the scan is complete, an HTML report will be generated, displaying open ports, services, and detected vulnerabilities.

### Example Output
After scanning, a file named `report.html` will be created in the project directory. Open it in your browser to view the results of the scan.
